## Aim âš¡

To create a website that helps models improve their craft at an amateur stage.

## Introduction

Generally when starting out beginners arenâ€™t comfortable with posing in front of strangers. Also itâ€™s expensive to hire a professional photographer at the start (here is when most of the models give up on their dreams) , This is where our website comes in, it acts like a personal coach , One stop solution for all who wanna make a killer portfolio.
Also during the time of covid many fashion models who just started out in the field couldnâ€™t attend photoshoots, fashion shows and events, and these are the three places from where an amateur model can learn from their mistakes and get advice on how to improve and be the next top model. Our website helps models point out their mistakes and aims to help them learn from them.

## Solution Proposed ðŸ¤–

We use a deep learning model that uses their footage and points out their mistakes, helping them overcome these and enabling them to have their best walk. The website will contain the following features-

- a. Pose correction using landmark detection.
- b. Help in showing expressions on cue.
- c. Helping with diets, exercise schedule, sleep schedule, pedicures and manicures.
- d. Helping models find jobs by having a job listing feature where companies can post job listings.

## Implementation ðŸ’¡

Using landmark detection we created a model identifying ideal model posture and expressions and integrated this model with the ideal environment for a wannabe fashion icon.

## Future Scope ðŸ“ˆ

We would like to add premium services for a premium membership like counselling with fashion icons. Access to blogs by industry specialists on future trends.

## Business Model ðŸ˜Œ

Competition for jobs is strong and clients' needs are specific, so patience and persistence are essential. Models spend most of their time being photographed. They must be comfortable in front of a camera for photographers to capture the desired look. Models must have basic knowledge of hair styling, makeup, and clothing. For photographic and runway work, models must be able to move gracefully and confidently. On top of all this models have to be up to date with all the fashion trends not only in magazines but especially on social media platforms.

- We could exploit the competitive nature of the job to make our product sell,
  If person A is using our product and posting their shots on instagram then we can market our product by using them.

- We would also like to offer and customize our services to fashion institutes for their use, and to fashion designers to be able to explain what they exactly want from their models better.
